## [unreleased](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/wayfarer/compare/v5.0.1...HEAD)
### Changed
- removed multiplexed events
- removed symbols dependency
- removed internal method exposure; the need for that was an indication of
  lower level problems that this patch fixes

### Added
- matched routes can now return values (useful for streams)
- Trie data structure can now be required doing `require('wayfarer/trie')`

### Fixed
- moved to using a single trie which greatly decreases lookup times
- moved lookup logic to separate (internal) data structure which improves perf
